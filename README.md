**# Credit-Risk-Analysis**

## Analyzing Financial institutions borrower. The data set used was provided via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mamtadhaker/lt-vehicle-loan-default-prediction?select=data_dictionary.csv). This was my last case study in my CareerFoundry course and was an exploratory analysis. Some actions taken included:

1. Open sourcing the data

2. Combining data with a .shp file for a more in-depth geographic analysis

3. Performing regression analysis and applying machine learning

4. Creating a Tableau storyboard with all analysis



## Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan rejection rates. The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions. 

## Key Questions

● What are the main factors behind defaulting?

● Is there any specific financial behaver for deflated customers, such as time using the loan, the cost they pay, employment type, etc.?

● Which area has the highest number of defaults?

● When are customers defaulted the most?
